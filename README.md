<h1>Memora</h1>

  <p><strong>Memora</strong> is a simple app built for storing and organizing your personal memories. You can add images, titles, descriptions, and emojis, making it a fun way to keep track of your moments. This project is developed as a school project using circular doubly linked lists for efficient memory storage.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Easily add images to the app with drag-and-drop functionality using the <strong>DND package</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Emoji Parsing</strong>: Thanks to <strong>Vincent DURMONT's library</strong>, we can parse emoji aliases (e.g., <code>:smile:</code>) to their actual emoji representation! 🎉</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Store memories with images, titles, descriptions, emojis, and the date.</li>
    <li><strong>Circular Doubly Linked List</strong>: All memories are stored in a circular doubly linked list for efficient retrieval and organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🐞 Known Issues</h2>
  <p>Please note, there are a few features that aren't yet fully implemented, but they are not bugs—just missing functionality for now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Management</strong>: We currently can't add users, but this feature will be added in the future. The system would allow each user to have their own set of memories stored securely.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Filtering</strong>: Right now, all memories from different users are shown. In the future, we plan to filter memories by the user, so you’ll only see your own memories in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DND Package</strong>: For drag-and-drop functionality to add images seamlessly.</li>
    <li><strong>Vincent DURMONT's Emoji Parser</strong>: To turn emoji aliases into actual emojis. <a href="https://github.com/vdurmont/emoji-java">Library link here</a></li>
    <li><strong>Circular Doubly Linked List</strong>: For efficient memory storage
