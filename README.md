  <h2>üêû Known Issues</h2>
  <p>Please note, there are a few features that aren't yet fully implemented, but they are not bugs‚Äîjust missing functionality for now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Management</strong>: The system would allow each user to have their own set of memories stored securely.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Filtering</strong>: Right now, all memories from different users are shown. In the future, we plan to filter memories by the user, so you‚Äôll only see your own memories in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DND Package</strong>: For drag-and-drop functionality to add images seamlessly.</li>
    <li><strong>Vincent DURMONT's Emoji Parser</strong>: To turn emoji aliases into actual emojis. <a href="https://github.com/vdurmont/emoji-java">Library link here</a></li>
    <li><strong>Circular Doubly Linked List</strong>: For efficient memory storage</li>
  </ul>
